\noindent I would like to first acknowledge Amit Ami for helping guide me through the thesis. We met nearly weekly to help ensure I was making progress and that it was consistent with the original work. Amit was a great help as both a mentor and someone who could double check my work. \\

\noindent I would also like to thank the developers of all the tools that were evaluated within the paper. Without these developers working to provide these tools I would not be able to find ways to improve them. I also appreciate that they were open to a discussion to find ways to improve the tools.\\

\noindent Finally, for early portions of the project I worked in collaboration with other students for class projects. These other students are Trevor Stalnaker, Johnny Clapham, and Jake Zappin I would like to thank them as well for contributing to the project.\\
